# Theirbot
Due to personal issues I've stopped with the maintenance and hosting of Theirbot. If you want to host it, follow these steps:
- Install git and node
- Clone the github repository
- Run `npm i` to install the packages
- Make a new file called `config.json` with the following contents:
```json
{
"token": "your-bot-token",
"clientID": "your-bot-id",
"guildID": "your-server-id"
}
```
